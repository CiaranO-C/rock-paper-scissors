## Technologies Used

## How to play

## Getting Started

Click here to play!

The game should work on most modern browsers, although I would recommend  Google Chrome!


## Game Rules

In this classic game the rules are already widely known! but for those with a foggy memory, or who have not played before:

- Rock beats Scissors
- Paper beats Rock
- Scissors beats Paper

Winner is dictated by first to win 5 rounds. Or the 'best of 3' style of play!


## Future improvements

Initially my game is intended to be played via the browser console. Once this has been achieved I will work into the GUI aspect of the project through the use of HTML and CSS for styling, giving a more polished look to the game.

It would also be a cool feature to allow the player to choose how many rounds they wish to play, or even unlimited rounds for the real Rock paper scissor fans! 

Ensure that the CSS is flexible so that the game can be played on mobile devices too.
